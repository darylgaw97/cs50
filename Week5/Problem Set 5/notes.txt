Use strcpy to copy type char * to type char[].


For freeing or adding to linked-list, drawing out what you are doing will help in implementing code and prevent orphaning nodes.


When traversing through linked list, DO NOT use "for (node *n = table[i]; n->next != NULL; n = n->next),
this will cause you to skip the last node in the linked list,
instead DO use "for (node *n = table[i]; n != NULL; n = n->next)", and this will correctly traverse the linked list up to and including the last node.


Remember to close file after finishing load to prevent memory leak.


Better the hash function, better the search time.


For time checking purpose, don't wait for output at terminal as it will take a long time,
instead, do this:
./speller text/aca.txt > output.txt
then read the time from the output file, it will save up a lot of time.


Your "hash" function must be case insensitive just like your "check" function,
otherwise, a word that need to be checked may be hashed into a different linked-list, causing a false negative on the search result.
