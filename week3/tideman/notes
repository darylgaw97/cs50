1. Got stucked on locked_pairs function, here is the takeaway:

    Compare the loop function in tideman.c against the one in prototype.c:
    
        Notice that in prototype, after the first recursion is called and finished running, a value is already returned to locked_pairs function,
        thereby disallowing the next "for loop" to be run, the code in prototype causes false negatives in certain scenarios.
        
    In conclusion, when using iteration loops in a recursive function, make sure when a recursive stack returns negative, the result is not
    returned immediately to the main function, instead, DO use the 'continue' operator to go to the next iteration to find another possible positive, 
    this way, if positive result lies ahead, it will not be ommited due to an earlier false negative return.


2. For implementing the various functions in tideman.c, drawing out the tables for the corresponding function helps tremmendously.
